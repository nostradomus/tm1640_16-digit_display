This folder contains :
 - PDF exports to produce and build the PCB for the shield without using the EAGLE software
    - these pdf files can be printed directly on transparencies for diy production. The pcb layouts have been mirrored in such a way that the printed side should be in direct contact with the photo-sensitive layer on the copper side for an optimal result.
 - PDF exports of the laser-cutting files
 - PDF versions of various documents (which otherwise require specific software)
 - Datasheets concerning the used components
